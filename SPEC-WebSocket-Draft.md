### Draft State

This draft is also implemented by [the Agoo server](https://github.com/ohler55/agoo) according to the specifications stated in [Rack PR#1272](https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1272).

---
## Purpose

This document details WebSocket / EventSource connection support for Rack servers.

The purpose of these specifications is:

1. To allow separation of concerns between the transport layer and the application, thereby allowing the application to be server agnostic.

    Simply put, when choosing between conforming servers, the application doesn’t need to have any knowledge about the chosen server.

2. To support “native" (server-side) WebSocket and EventSource (SSE) connections and using application side callbacks.

    Simply put, to make it easy for applications to accept WebSocket and EventSource (SSE) connections from WebSocket and EventSource clients (commonly browsers) while abstracting away any transport layer details.

3. Allow applications to use WebSocket and EventSource (SSE) on HTTP/2 servers. Note: current `hijack` practices will break network connections when attempting to implement EventSource (SSE).

## Rack WebSockets / EventSource

Servers that publish WebSocket and/or EventSource (SSE) support using the `env['rack.upgrade?']` value MUST follow the requirements set in this document.

This document reserves the Rack `env` Hash keys of `rack.upgrade?` and `rack.upgrade`.

A conforming server MUST set `env['rack.upgrade?']` to `:websocket` for incoming WebSocket connections and `:sse` for incoming EventSource (SSE) connections.

If a connection is not "upgradable", a conforming server SHOULD set `env['rack.upgrade?']` to either `nil` or `false`. 

The historical use of `upgrade.websocket?` and `upgrade.websocket` (iodine 0.4.x) will be gradually deprecated.

### The WebSocket / EventSource Callback Object

WebSocket and EventSource connection upgrade and handling is performed using a Callback Object.

The Callback Object could be a any object which implements any of the following callbacks:

* `on_open(client)` WILL be called once the connection had been established.

* `on_message(client, data)` WILL be called when incoming WebSocket data is received.

    This callback is ignored for EventSource connections.

    `data` will be a String with an encoding of UTF-8 for text messages and `binary` encoding for non-text messages (as specified by the WebSocket Protocol).

    The *callback object* **MUST** assume that the `data` String will be a **recyclable buffer** and that it's content will be corrupted the moment the `on_message` callback returns.

    Servers **MAY**, optionally, implement a **recyclable buffer** for the `on_message` callback. However, this is optional and it is *not* required.

* `on_drained(client)` **MAY** be called when the the `client.write` buffer becomes empty. **If** `client.pending` returns a non-zero value, the `on_drained` callback **MUST** be called once the write buffer becomes empty.

* `on_shutdown(client)` **MAY** be called during the server's graceful shutdown process, _before_ the connection is closed and in addition to the `on_close` function (which is called _after_ the connection is closed.

* `on_close(client)` **MUST** be called _after_ the connection was closed for whatever reason (socket errors, parsing errors, timeouts, client disconnection, `client.close` being called, etc').


The server **MUST** provide the Callback Object with a `client` object, that supports the following methods (this approach promises applications could be server agnostic):

* `write(data)` will schedule the data to be sent. `data` **MUST** be a String.

    A call to `write` only promises that the data is scheduled to be sent. Servers are encouraged to avoid blocking and return immediately, deferring the actual `write` operation for later.

    `write` shall return `true` on success and `false` if the connection is closed.

    For WebSocket connections only (irrelevant for EventSource connections):

    * If `data` is UTF-8 encoded, the data will be sent as text.

    * If `data` is binary encoded it will be sent as non-text (as specified by the WebSocket Protocol).

    A server **SHOULD** document whether `write` will block. It is **RECOMMENDED** that servers implement buffered IO, allowing `write` to return immediately when resources allow and block (or, possibly, disconnect) when the IO buffer is full.

* `close` closes the connection once all the data in the outgoing queue was sent. If `close` is called while there is still data to be sent, `close` will only take effect once the data was sent.

    `close` shall always return `nil`.

* `open?` returns `true` if the connection isn't known to have been closed and `false` if the connection is known to be closed or marked to be closed.

* `pending` **MUST** return -1 if the connection is closed. Otherwise, `pending` **SHOULD** return the number of pending writes (messages in the `write` queue\*) that need to be processed before the next time the `on_drained` callback is called.

    Servers **MAY** choose to always return the value `0` if they never call the `on_drained` callback and the connection is open.

    Servers that return a positive number MUST call the `on_drained` callback when a call to `pending` would return the value `0`.

    \*Servers that divide large messages into a number of smaller messages (implement message fragmentation) MAY count each fragment separately, as if the fragmentation was performed by the user and `write` was called more than once per message.

* `env` returns the Rack `env` hash related to the originating HTTP request. Some changes to the `env` hash (such as removal of the IO hijacking support) MAY be implemented by the server.

WebSocket `ping` / `pong`, timeouts and network considerations should be implemented by the server. It is **RECOMMENDED** (but not required) that the server send `ping`s to prevent connection timeouts and detect network failure.

Server settings **MAY** (not required) be provided to allow for customization and adaptation for different network environments or WebSocket extensions. It is **RECOMMENDED** that any settings be available as command line arguments and **not** incorporated into the application's logic.

## Implementation Examples

### Server-Client Upgrade to WebSockets / EventSource

* **Server**:

    When a WebSocket upgrade request arrives, the server will set the `env['rack.upgrade?']` flag to `:websocket`, indicating that: 1. this specific request is upgradable; and 2. the server supports this specification for WebSocket connections.

    When an EventSource request arrives, the server will set the `env['rack.upgrade?']` flag to `:sse`, indicating that: 1. this specific request is an EventSource request; and 2. the server supports this specification.

* **Client**:

    When a client decides to upgrade a request, they will place an appropriate Callback Object in the `env['rack.upgrade']` Hash key.

* **Server**:

    1. The server will review the `env` Hash *before* sending the response. If the `env['rack.upgrade']` was set, the server will perform the upgrade.

    2. The server will send the correct response status and headers, as well as any headers present in the response object. The server will also perform any required housekeeping, such as closing the response body, if it exists.

         The response status provided by the response object shall be ignored and the correct response status shall be set by the server.

         If the application's response status indicates an error or a redirection (status code >= 300), the server shall ignore the Callback Object.

    3. Once the upgrade had completed, the server will call the `on_open` callback.

        No other callbacks shall be called until the `on_open` callback had returned.

        WebSocket messages shall be handled by the `on_message` callback in the same order in which they arrive and the `on_message` will **not** be executed concurrently for the same connection.

        The `on_close` callback will **not** be called while any other callback is running (`on_open`, `on_message`, `on_drained`, etc').

        The `on_drained` callback might be called concurrently with the `on_message` callback, allowing data to be sent even while other data is being processed. Multi-threading considerations may apply.

## Example Usage

The following is an example WebSocket echo server implemented using this specification:

```ruby
class WSConnection
    def on_open(client)
        puts "WebSocket connection established."
    end
    def on_message(client, data)
        client.write data
        puts "on_drained MUST be implemented if #{ pending } != 0."
    end
    def on_drained(client)
        puts "Yap,on_drained is implemented."
    end
    def on_shutdown(client)
        client.write "The server is going away. Goodbye."
    end
    def on_close(client)
        puts "WebSocket connection closed."
    end
end

module App
   def self.call(env)
       if(env['rack.upgrade?'.freeze] == :websocket)
           env['rack.upgrade'.freeze] = WSConnection.new
           return [0, {}, []]
       end
       return [200, {"Content-Length" => "12", "Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Hello World!"]]
   end
end

run App
```

The following example uses Push notifications for both WebSocket and SSE connections. The Pub/Sub API isn't part of this specification but it is supported by iodine:

```ruby
class Chat
    def initialize(nickname)
        @nickname = nickname
    end
    def on_open(client)
        client.subscribe "chat"
        client.publish "chat", "#{@nickname} joined the chat."
    end
    def on_message(client, data)
        client.publish "chat", "#{@nickname}: #{data}"
    end
    def on_close(client)
        client.publish "chat", "#{@nickname}: left the chat."
    end
end

module App
   def self.call(env)
       if(env['rack.upgrade?'.freeze])
           nickname = env['PATH_INFO'][1..-1]
           nickname = "Someone" if nickname == "".freeze
           env['rack.upgrade'.freeze] = Chat.new(nickname)
           return [0, {}, []]
       end
       return [200, {"Content-Length" => "12", "Content-Type" => "text/plain"}, ["Hello World!"]]
   end
end

run App
```

Note that SSE connections will only be able to receive messages (the `on_message` callback is never called).
